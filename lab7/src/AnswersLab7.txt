Answers for Lab 7
-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Which methods in the DLQueue class are taking in a parameter of the generic type T?
Enqueue and Dequeue methods are taking in a parameter of the generic type T.


2. Which methods in the DLQueue class have a return type of the generic type T?
The Dequeue method has a return type of the generic type T.


3. Suppose you didn't have an instance variable storing the current number of elements in the queue. How could you determine the number of elements for the size() method if such an instance variable was not available?
You could use loops to iterate through the queue and count the number of elements in the queue.


EXERCISE 2

4. Consider the possibility of using an Array Queue or a Circular Array Queue instead of the Doubly Linked Queue being used in this simulation. Would the simulation's results be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation?
The simulation's results would not be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation.


5. Which line(s) of code in Snail.java and/or SnailRace.java would you have to modify if you were going to use a different queue implementation?
You would have to modify the following line of code in Snail.java
private QueueADT<Integer> movePattern
to use the new queue implementation.
then, enqueue, dequeue and many other methods in Snail.java and SnailRace.java would have to be modified to use the new queue implementation.
