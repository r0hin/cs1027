EXERCISE 2


5. When i begins at 20, why are we not seeing 20 nodes printed out? How many nodes are in the linked list?
Still only 10. Because the printlist function uses loop with 10.


6. When i begins at 5, why does the program crash after printing out the number 5? How many nodes are in the linked list? What kind of exception is thrown here?
Upon the 6th iteration current is null and no method getElement(). NullPointerException is thrown.


EXERCISE 3


7. What are the 4 possible cases we need to consider? What would curr be equal to (or NOT equal to) in each of these 4 cases?

FRONT OF LIST: curr = front
BACK OF LIST: curr = back
MIDDLE OF LIST: curr not equal to front or back
NOT IN LIST: loop thru list, no match, curr = null
